h2. running elexis-3 with a demoDB inside docker

h3. Build the docker image from source

bq. git clone https://github.com/ngiger/docker-x2go-wheezy
cd docker-x2go-wheezy

Adapt the apt-proy name to your like and run @docker build -t your_name .@

Now your are ready to 

bq. CID=$(docker run -p 2222:22 --detach --tty your_name) # bash
set -x  CID (docker run -p 2222:22 --detach --tty your_name) # fish
docker logs $CID

note the root password

h3. How to run/connect to server with a Client?

Download the x2go client for your OS from:
http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient

Create a new session and connect to your seerver
Host : (Your Server IP) Port : 2222 Username : dockerx Password : elexisTest
Application: /usr/share/Elexis3/Elexis3 -data /tmp/ws

You can also SSH to the docker container directly with root or dockerx users and their passwords over the port 2222 with linux ssh or windows putty client.

h3. Running the x2go-client inside a browser

You will need an apache2 server and the x2goplugin installed. Under apache2 you will find a simple Dockerfile which you can build and run

bq. docker build -t x2goplugin
set -x  CID (docker run -p 8080:80 --detach --tty ngiger:x2goplugin)

Now you should be able to point your browser to http://localhost:8080/x2goplugin.html and connect to your other docker running the x2goserver.
